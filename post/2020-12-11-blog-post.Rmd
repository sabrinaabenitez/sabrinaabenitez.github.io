##NYC Flights
Using the skills I learned in my computational biology course at UT Austin, I will show a simple, yet effective, way to combine the power of R and Python. NYC is one of my favorite cities to visit. I admire how diverse the city is, as well as the hustle and bustle of people moving in and out every second! For this reason, I have decided to use a dataset that holds flight data from the three NYC area airports from 2013. Specifically, I will be looking at flight data from the JFK airport. As a lover of travel(always looking for ways to add miles), I will find the mean distance for flights leaving JFK in 2013.

```{R}
library(nycflights13)
library(tidyverse)
library(reticulate)
flights<-flights
flightsjfk <- flights %>% filter(origin == "JFK")
```
```{python}
r.flightsjfk.distance.mean()
```

The average distance out of JFK is 1266 miles! Notice how we used BOTH R and Python functions to come to this conclusion. 

##Using reticulate to combine R and Python
Using reticulate, we can show how R and Python can communicate and share information across code chunks!
```{R}
Ilove <- "If I can make it there,"
```

```{python}
NY="I'm gonna make it anywhere!"
print(r.Ilove,NY)
```
