      <description>Introduction Title: Exploration of the relationship between heart failure and potential risk factors.
This project will explore the incidence of death due to heart failure and potential associations with risk factors, such as age, diabetes, or high blood pressure. This dataset was acquired from kaggle.com. The dataset contains various clinically assessed risk factors, such as smoker status and age. This data exploration is of interest to me, personally, because many members of my family suffer from cardiovascular disease.</description>
